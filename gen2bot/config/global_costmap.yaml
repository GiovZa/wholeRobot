# The global costmap gets the position of the entire arena and makes a global planner that gives an
# initial abstract path for the robot to follow. It takes obstacles from the octomap server
# This costmap doesn't account for craters in it's path planner.

# Global frame must be a static map, which is a stagnant position in empty space and be within 
# the same tf tree with base_link which is the tf frame of the robot, what updates the position 
# of the robot's frame relative to the map frame are tf broadcasters that use sensors fused into
# into the odom frame. Proper tf tree setup: map -> odom -> base_link -> sensors' frames
# How we have it set up, the global frame uses Intel's VIO (Visual IMU Odometry) to get global to odom

# TF Tree diagram:
#                                  -> base_link -> base_footprint
# We have map -> camera_pose_frame
#                                  -> camera_link -> all camera sensors -> object_22 (QR code)
global_frame: map

# We don't want it to track unknown space because otherwise it will assume the space immediately in
# front of the robot that the cameras can't see must contain an obstacle and immobilizes bot
track_unknown_space: false
