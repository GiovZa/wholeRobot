Launch scripts are what opens many ros nodes and files in one terminal command

rgbd.launch is a launch file someone made to make jetsons work with realsense depth cams

motorTesting.launch is a launch file to configure PID for all motors in new trencher bot

ignore all other files, they are constantly changing for testing purposes
